 ### Problem Description
This is where the problem description should be written.

If you need to add new questions to a problem, simply duplicate this folder, and edit the `Problem.md` and `StarterCode.js` files accordingly. Make sure that the folders are named 'Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3' and so on.
 
 ### Brief Markdown Cheatsheet
Just like the Briefing tab, everything here is written in Markdown.

This means that you can **bolden** or *italicize* text by adding asterisks.

Code-blocks can be formatted through the use of backticks:
```
// This is a code example
```
If you want to in-line code, rather than display a whole code-block, you can also do `this`. 

Lists can be created by adding dashes to the start of a line:
- First element
- Second element
- Third element

It is also possible to embed images, like this:
